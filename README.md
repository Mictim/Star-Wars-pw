# Star Wars

STAR WARS web page using the information from the [SWAPI] API (https://swapi.dev/ "SWAPI documentation").

The developed website is a website with information about the Star Wars ships and their pilots. The ship list is the one obtained from the API.

The registration screen allows users to register through **Localstorage**, and log in later. The ship list is only visible to registered users.

It also shows a list of the actors, with details on what ships they can fly and the movies they appear in.
